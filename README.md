# Sales-Analysis-Excel-Project
Bike Sales Analysis Report
This project entails a detailed analysis of bike sales data of AutoTech Innovations Pvt Ltd Company using Microsoft Excel, structured into three main steps: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing, Pivot Tables and Charts, and Sales Analysis Dashboard creation.

In the Data Cleaning and Preprocessing step, I begin by inspecting the dataset for any missing values and handle them appropriately, either through imputation or removal. Next, I ensure that numerical columns such as Income, Age, Children, and Cars are correctly formatted as numerical data types, and categorical columns such as Gender, Marital Status, Education, Occupation, Home Owner, Commute Distance, Region, and Purchased Bike are properly categorized. I also perform consistency checks on categorical columns to ensure uniformity in data entries, such as ensuring 'Yes'/'No' responses are consistent in the Home Owner column.

Moving on to the Pivot Tables and Charts step, I create various pivot tables and corresponding charts to uncover insights from the dataset. These include:

Sales by Region: A pivot table and bar chart showing the distribution of bike sales across different regions.
Sales by Gender and Marital Status: A pivot table and pie chart illustrating sales based on gender and marital status.
Income vs. Bike Purchases: An analysis using a pivot table and scatter plot to examine the relationship between income levels and bike purchasing behavior.
Age Distribution: A pivot table and histogram displaying the age distribution of customers.
Commute Distance and Car Ownership: A pivot table and stacked bar chart analyzing the relationship between commute distance and car ownership.
Finally, in the Sales Analysis Dashboard step, I integrate the above pivot tables and charts into an interactive dashboard in Excel. This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of key metrics and trends in bike sales, with interactive elements such as slicers to enhance user experience and allow for dynamic data exploration. The project guide provides step-by-step instructions for creating pivot tables, charts, and an engaging dashboard, making it a valuable resource for anyone looking to analyze sales data effectively using Excel.
